# Classic Television Soundtracks Playlist
### Live Site: https://gerald2399.github.io/Classic-Television-Soundtracks-Playlist/

### Description 
This is a front-end playlist app I created of soundtracks and intros from classic television shows of the 1980s using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The playlist comes with volume 
control functionality with the volume slider in place and the ability for the user to navigate through the playlist using the previous and next buttons in place or clicking on
the soundtrack or intro of their choice in the playlist.
